Goal
  Turn last week’s working pipeline into something scalable and safe: bigger sweeps, automatic checks, and predictable outputs.

Problems we’re addressing

  Manual publishing/checks don’t scale → add CI to run tests & parity and save artifacts.

  Tuning coverage too thin → expand grid with explicit guards to control cost.

  Occasional nondeterminism → tighten seeds, ordering, and schema checks.

  Performance dips in tuning → switch to batched Parquet I/O + basic parallelism where safe.

What “good” looks like by Friday

  fdos run tune completes with >300 combos guarded (or a smaller preview behind --max-combos)

  CI run is green: tests pass, parity passes, artifacts uploaded (PBIX, manifests, run logs)

  PBIX “Tuning Results” shows meaningful slicers for vol/cost and a clear top-configs table
