  - Expanded pipeline to handle multiple tickers (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA)

  - Partitioned Parquet outputs

  - Feature engineering (SMA10)

  - Power BI dashboard with:

  - Closing Price vs SMA lines

  - Volume bars on secondary axis

  - Dynamic chart title linked to slicer

  - Clean finance-style formatting

Week 3 – Expanding History & Feature Store (🚧 in progress)
