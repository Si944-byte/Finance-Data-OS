  - Ship feature_mart.parquet (single tidy table for BI/analytics).

  - Power BI 3-page dashboard:

    Price vs. SMA10 with KPI cards (Latest Close, Latest SMA10, Close vs SMA10 %).

    Volatility & Distribution ‚Äî daily return line, vol20 trend with reference lines, histogram of returns.

    Overview/Compare ‚Äî normalized close (start=1.0), summary table (Avg Return %, Vol, Cumulative Return %, Latest Close, CAGR %, Positive Day %), bar chart with conditional       formatting.

  - DAX measures: Avg Return %, Vol (stdev of return1), Positive Day %, Latest Close, Latest SMA10, Close vs SMA10 %, Cumulative Return %, CAGR %.

  - Date table (DAX) and relationship to fact tables for robust time slicing.

### üß† What I Learned

**Week 1 ‚Äì Single-Ticker Prototype**  
- Learned what a **Parquet file** is: a columnar storage format optimized for analytics.  
- Unlike CSV, Parquet is **compressed, faster to query, and schema-aware**, which makes it essential when dealing with **large amounts of financial data**.  
- Saw firsthand how partitioned Parquet reduces storage size and improves performance when scaling beyond one ticker.  

**Week 2 ‚Äì Multi-Ticker Ingest & Finance Chart**  
- Learned how to extend the pipeline to **multiple tickers** and why partitioning by `ticker` and `year` is critical for efficient querying.  
- Discovered how **Pandera schema validation** enforces data quality rules before the data moves downstream ‚Äî preventing ‚Äúbad data‚Äù from entering the feature store.  
- Understood how to compute **technical indicators** like SMA (Simple Moving Average) and **returns**, which are core to financial analysis.  
- Improved skills in **Power BI visualization**: building combo charts, formatting axes, and designing finance-ready dashboards that balance clarity and detail. (really focused on cleaning up the charts this week)
  
**Week 3 ‚Äì Expanding History & Feature Store**  
- Adjusted vs. unadjusted prices: Using yfinance(auto_adjust=True) means the Close is already split/dividend‚Äêadjusted, so there‚Äôs no need for an Adj_Close column. This removed a whole class of schema errors.
- Idempotent ‚Äúrepair pass‚Äù pays off: A small, re-runnable step that re-coerces types, fills missing ticker, and trims rows to the folder‚Äôs ticker/year makes the lake reliable and easy to fix if something goes wrong.
- Partition consistency matters: Validating that file paths (e.g., ticker=MSFT/year=2024) agree with row values (ticker and date.year) catches subtle mistakes early.
- Rolling features need alignment guards: Rolling windows and % change can misalign indexes; explicitly resetting index and checking equal lengths avoids silent drift.
- Cumulative Return vs. CAGR:
    Cumulative Return % = total growth over the selected period (product of daily returns ‚àí 1).
    CAGR % = the annualized growth rate across the same period, which makes different date ranges comparable.
- Date table = better time intelligence: A proper DAX Date table with one-to-many relationships enables consistent slicers, % by year/month, and avoids filter ambiguity.
- Power BI modeling tricks:
    Dynamic titles with SELECTEDVALUE improve clarity.
    Rule-based conditional formatting draws attention to outliers (e.g., highest Avg Return %).
    Reference lines (e.g., 20% vol) and consistent axes make charts easier to read across tickers.
- ‚ÄúFeature Mart‚Äù is a contract: Finalizing a tidy, validated feature_mart.parquet (date, ticker, close, return1, sma10, vol20) simplifies downstream analytics and BI.
- Small design polish matters: Finance-style cards, subtle gridlines, neutral palette, and consistent units (%, USD) improve perceived quality without extra compl

**Week 4 ‚Äì Signals, Backtest & 3-Page Power BI** 
- Next-bar execution prevents look-ahead.
Shifting signals by one day (position[t] = signal[t-1]) keeps the backtest honest and reproducible.
- A dedicated Signals Mart simplifies BI.
Precomputing MAs/volatility and boolean rules in parquet keeps the report fast and the DAX minimal.
- Date is the hub. Using a single Date table with one-way filters into each fact table eliminates circular filters and odd totals.
- KPIs you can trust. Simple, transparent formulas (CAGR from daily equity, Sharpe from daily mean/stdev, Max DD via running peak) + sanity checks (end equity ‚âà product of returns) caught mistakes early.
- Visual clarity beats clever markers. Scatter markers for every buy/exit look noisy at daily granularity; price + SMA lines with KPI cards tell the story better.
- Operational detail matters. Importing parquet via full file paths on Windows made refresh reliable; consistent formatting (decimals, % signs) made the report feel ‚Äúfinished.‚Äù
- Small UX touches help. Dynamic page titles (ticker + date range) and a Reset bookmark improve readability and exploration

**Week 5 ‚Äì Costs, Controls, Tuning & Power BI** 
1) Paths & environments must be bulletproof.
We hit ‚Äúfile not found‚Äù due to a stray notebooks\lake\ and mixed slashes. Fix: a robust path discovery helper that walks parents to the first folder that actually contains expected parquet names, and loudly warns if a shadow lake exists under notebooks.
2) Respect your schema contract‚Äîbut be tolerant.
Columns varied between steps (ret_after_cost vs earlier names). The loader now:
  - Prefers in-memory per_ticker_daily when available (same session).
  - Else reads parquet excluding _summary, accepting common column variants, then normalizes to date, ticker, return1, position.
3) Small API clarity prevents big breakage.
Errors like ‚Äútrades_from_position not defined‚Äù came from mismatched cell ordering/names. We centralized helpers (build_signals_v2, run_backtest_with_costs, kpi, load_per_ticker_daily) and called them consistently.
4) Grid search pitfalls.
The initial tuning loop threw ‚Äútoo many values to unpack‚Äù and undefined GRID_FAST. Resolution: define grid lists up front; use a single nested loop (for f in GRID_FAST / for s in GRID_SLOW / for v in GRID_VOL) and return KPI() per combo. Keep the function pure (input fm ‚Üí output summary rows).
5) Sanity checks save time.
A couple asserts caught issues early: date parsing, empty tables, KPI drift (CAGR mismatch). For single-element Series, cast with .iloc[0] to avoid future pandas warnings.
6) DAX should mirror the data you actually ingested.
  -We removed references to nonexistent columns (e.g., sma50, rev_strat), anchored measures to Week-5 fields, and fixed:
    - Latest Close using lastDate = MAX('Date'[Date]) then CALCULATE(MAX(backtest_mart_v2[close]), 'Date'[Date] = lastDate).
    - Monthly heatmap: diverging CF center = 0.00, Month sorted by Month Number.
7) Modeling discipline in Power BI.
Kept single-direction relationships (Date/Ticker ‚Üí facts) to avoid filter ambiguity. The Normalized Close issue for AAPL was traced to filtering/measure scope; verifying ALLSELECTED context and slicers fixed it.
8) UX polish matters.
Consistent number formats, legible line weights, clean slicers, and concise cards made the 3 pages read clearly. Heatmap totals and centered color scale improved interpretation at a glance.

Main issues this week (and how we solved them)

‚ùå Lake paths resolving to notebooks\lake ‚Üí ‚úÖ parent-walk path discovery + warning if duplicate lake exists.

‚ùå Missing parquet columns / name drift ‚Üí ‚úÖ tolerant loader + normalized column names.

‚ùå Undefined helpers / variable names (per_ticker_daily, GRID_FAST) ‚Üí ‚úÖ consolidated helper section + explicit grid lists.

‚ùå Grid tuning ‚Äútoo many values to unpack‚Äù ‚Üí ‚úÖ simplified nested loops; return KPI summary rows.

‚ùå KPI assert mismatch (Series casting) ‚Üí ‚úÖ use .iloc[0] and numeric casts.

‚ùå DAX measures referring to non-ingested fields ‚Üí ‚úÖ measures rewritten to Week-5 fields only (e.g., ret_after_cost, close).

**Week 6 ‚Äì Rolling Metrics, Cost Modeling and Cleaner Pipeline**
Technical

  Costs must be tied to position toggles
  Applying per-toggle costs (entry/exit) eliminates ambiguous ‚Äúsign‚Äù logic and makes the invariant testable: ret_after_cost <= return1 in-market, and ‚âà0 when flat & not toggling.

  Position derivation is a first-class transform
  Deriving position from long_rule/exit_rule (cumsum, clip 0..1) stabilized downstream metrics and made tests deterministic.

  Rolling metrics are easiest from equity
  Daily ret_after_cost ‚Üí equity ‚Üí drawdown / rolling Sharpe / rolling window CAGR. This avoids subtle compounding mistakes when rolling on raw returns.

  Schemas + manifests pay off
  Pandera checks caught dtype/column drift early; writing manifest.json with config_hash gave provenance for every parquet.

  Testing from notebooks vs CLI
  Running pytest inside the notebook is fine, but keeping a repo-root command (set PYTHONPATH=src && python -m pytest -q tests) ensured imports and relative paths match CI.

  Version pinning matters
  numpy==1.26.* and pandera==0.17.* prevented the np.string_ / SchemaModel surprises seen on 2.x / newer Pandera.

  Path hygiene
  The ‚Äúdouble notebooks‚Äù path issue surfaced why all code should use fdos.paths + Path.cwd() guards; fixtures live under tests/fixtures/ to be repo-relative.

Process / Analytics

  Parity fixtures calm the BI delta anxiety
  Freezes last week‚Äôs KPIs to detect ‚Äúreal‚Äù vs ‚Äútooling‚Äù changes.

  Small, focused tests > broad assertions
  The SMA ‚Äúhead NaNs only‚Äù and cost-sign invariants were quick to run and highly diagnostic.

  Communicate visual changes in the About page
  Users accept KPI drift when the model change and test protection are explained up front.

Keep / Change

  Keep: manifests, parity test, pinning, BI query discipline (disable old, don‚Äôt delete).

  Change: add proper logging + run IDs; lift tests into CI; add a slim CLI for reproducible runs.

  Week-7 Preview 

    CLI (fdos run <stage> --config ...) with logging & run IDs.

    Incremental build --since to speed dev loops.

    Expand parity fixtures to include daily spot checks (not just summary).

    Add a basic parameter report (top SMA grid combos per ticker) into PBIX.
