    return1 (daily % return)

    sma10 (10-day simple moving average)

    vol20 (20-day rolling stdev of close)

  - Ship feature_mart.parquet (single tidy table for BI/analytics).

  - Power BI 3-page dashboard:

    Price vs. SMA10 with KPI cards (Latest Close, Latest SMA10, Close vs SMA10 %).

    Volatility & Distribution ‚Äî daily return line, vol20 trend with reference lines, histogram of returns.

    Overview/Compare ‚Äî normalized close (start=1.0), summary table (Avg Return %, Vol, Cumulative Return %, Latest Close, CAGR %, Positive Day %), bar chart with conditional       formatting.

  - DAX measures: Avg Return %, Vol (stdev of return1), Positive Day %, Latest Close, Latest SMA10, Close vs SMA10 %, Cumulative Return %, CAGR %.

  - Date table (DAX) and relationship to fact tables for robust time slicing.

  - Notebook + build log: Week 3 .ipynb and documentation added for reproducibility.

Week 4 ‚Äì Signals, Backtest & 3-Page Power BI ‚úÖ

  - Build Signals Mart

    - Compute sma50 and vol20 (20-day stdev of return1)

    - Create rules: long_rule (sma10 ‚â• sma50 & low-vol), exit_rule (sma10 < sma50 or high-vol)

    - Write lake/signals_mart.parquet

  - Implement long-only backtest (next-bar execution)

    - position[t] = long_rule[t-1] ‚Üí ret_strat = position * return1 ‚Üí equity = (1+ret_strat).cumprod()

üó∫Ô∏è Week 5 ‚Äî What's New

Costs, Controls & Tuning

Goal: Produce after-cost strategy returns, KPIs, an optional parameter grid search, and a refreshed Power BI model.

Outputs: (written to lake\)

  signals_mart_v2.parquet ‚Äî ticker, date, close, sma_fast, sma_slow, vol20, long_rule, exit_rule, regime_low_vol

  backtest_mart_v2\*.parquet ‚Äî per-ticker dailies: date, ticker, return1, position, ret_after_cost, equity, close

  backtest_mart_v2\_summary.parquet ‚Äî by-ticker KPIs: CAGR %, Sharpe, Max DD %, Win Rate %

  trades_mart_v1\*.parquet ‚Äî trade events with cost model fields

  tuning_mart.parquet (optional) ‚Äî KPI summary per [sma_fast, sma_slow, vol_threshold] combo

How to reproduce:

  1. Open the Week-5 notebook from the repo‚Äôs notebooks/ folder.

  2. Run Path Discovery (auto-finds nearest lake\ with expected files).

  3. Run Parameters & Helpers (set SMA/VOL/COST_BPS).

  4. Execute Build Signals v2 ‚Üí Run Backtest (after-cost).

  5. Execute Trades Log (optional, writes per-ticker parquet).

  6. Execute Tuning (optional grid search; writes tuning_mart.parquet).

  7. Run Sanity Checks (shape, columns, KPIs within tolerance).

  8.In Power BI, connect to:
   backtest_mart_v2\_summary.parquet
   Folder backtest_mart_v2\ (per-ticker dailies)
   signals_mart_v2.parquet
   (Optional) tuning_mart.parquet

  9. Confirm model relationships: Date[Date] ‚Üí * single-direction, Ticker[ticker] ‚Üí * single-direction to each mart.

  10. Create/refresh measures (DAX) using this week‚Äôs ingests:
    Daily Return = SUM(backtest_mart_v2[ret_after_cost])
    Equity (cum) via PRODUCTX over selected dates
    Cumulative Return % = [Equity (cum)] - 1
    CAGR % using years = DISTINCTCOUNT('Date'[Date]) / 252
    Sharpe (annual) = AVERAGEX(...) / STDEVX.P(...) * SQRT(252)
    Win Rate % = COUNTROWS(Return>0) / COUNTROWS(Date)
    Max DD % (running high vs equity; returns negative %)
    Latest Close = VAR lastDate = MAX('Date'[Date]) RETURN CALCULATE(MAX(backtest_mart_v2[close]), 'Date'[Date] = lastDate)

Notes & assumptions:
  
  - Next-bar execution; per-side COST_BPS charged on both entry and exit
  - No dividends/fees/borrow modeled unless in source price; no slippage beyond fixed bps
  - Results are illustrative; use for research only

### üß† What I Learned

**Week 1 ‚Äì Single-Ticker Prototype**  
- Learned what a **Parquet file** is: a columnar storage format optimized for analytics.  
- Unlike CSV, Parquet is **compressed, faster to query, and schema-aware**, which makes it essential when dealing with **large amounts of financial data**.  
- Saw firsthand how partitioned Parquet reduces storage size and improves performance when scaling beyond one ticker.  

**Week 2 ‚Äì Multi-Ticker Ingest & Finance Chart**  
- Learned how to extend the pipeline to **multiple tickers** and why partitioning by `ticker` and `year` is critical for efficient querying.  
- Discovered how **Pandera schema validation** enforces data quality rules before the data moves downstream ‚Äî preventing ‚Äúbad data‚Äù from entering the feature store.  
- Understood how to compute **technical indicators** like SMA (Simple Moving Average) and **returns**, which are core to financial analysis.  
- Improved skills in **Power BI visualization**: building combo charts, formatting axes, and designing finance-ready dashboards that balance clarity and detail. (really focused on cleaning up the charts this week)
  
**Week 3 ‚Äì Expanding History & Feature Store**  
- Adjusted vs. unadjusted prices: Using yfinance(auto_adjust=True) means the Close is already split/dividend‚Äêadjusted, so there‚Äôs no need for an Adj_Close column. This removed a whole class of schema errors.
- Idempotent ‚Äúrepair pass‚Äù pays off: A small, re-runnable step that re-coerces types, fills missing ticker, and trims rows to the folder‚Äôs ticker/year makes the lake reliable and easy to fix if something goes wrong.
- Partition consistency matters: Validating that file paths (e.g., ticker=MSFT/year=2024) agree with row values (ticker and date.year) catches subtle mistakes early.
- Rolling features need alignment guards: Rolling windows and % change can misalign indexes; explicitly resetting index and checking equal lengths avoids silent drift.
- Cumulative Return vs. CAGR:
    Cumulative Return % = total growth over the selected period (product of daily returns ‚àí 1).
    CAGR % = the annualized growth rate across the same period, which makes different date ranges comparable.
- Date table = better time intelligence: A proper DAX Date table with one-to-many relationships enables consistent slicers, % by year/month, and avoids filter ambiguity.
- Power BI modeling tricks:
    Dynamic titles with SELECTEDVALUE improve clarity.
    Rule-based conditional formatting draws attention to outliers (e.g., highest Avg Return %).
    Reference lines (e.g., 20% vol) and consistent axes make charts easier to read across tickers.
- ‚ÄúFeature Mart‚Äù is a contract: Finalizing a tidy, validated feature_mart.parquet (date, ticker, close, return1, sma10, vol20) simplifies downstream analytics and BI.
- Small design polish matters: Finance-style cards, subtle gridlines, neutral palette, and consistent units (%, USD) improve perceived quality without extra compl

**Week 4 ‚Äì Signals, Backtest & 3-Page Power BI** 
- Next-bar execution prevents look-ahead.
Shifting signals by one day (position[t] = signal[t-1]) keeps the backtest honest and reproducible.
- A dedicated Signals Mart simplifies BI.
Precomputing MAs/volatility and boolean rules in parquet keeps the report fast and the DAX minimal.
- Date is the hub. Using a single Date table with one-way filters into each fact table eliminates circular filters and odd totals.
- KPIs you can trust. Simple, transparent formulas (CAGR from daily equity, Sharpe from daily mean/stdev, Max DD via running peak) + sanity checks (end equity ‚âà product of returns) caught mistakes early.
- Visual clarity beats clever markers. Scatter markers for every buy/exit look noisy at daily granularity; price + SMA lines with KPI cards tell the story better.
- Operational detail matters. Importing parquet via full file paths on Windows made refresh reliable; consistent formatting (decimals, % signs) made the report feel ‚Äúfinished.‚Äù
- Small UX touches help. Dynamic page titles (ticker + date range) and a Reset bookmark improve readability and exploration

**Week 5 ‚Äì Costs, Controls, Tuning & Power BI** 
1) Paths & environments must be bulletproof.
We hit ‚Äúfile not found‚Äù due to a stray notebooks\lake\ and mixed slashes. Fix: a robust path discovery helper that walks parents to the first folder that actually contains expected parquet names, and loudly warns if a shadow lake exists under notebooks.
2) Respect your schema contract‚Äîbut be tolerant.
Columns varied between steps (ret_after_cost vs earlier names). The loader now:
  - Prefers in-memory per_ticker_daily when available (same session).
  - Else reads parquet excluding _summary, accepting common column variants, then normalizes to date, ticker, return1, position.
3) Small API clarity prevents big breakage.
Errors like ‚Äútrades_from_position not defined‚Äù came from mismatched cell ordering/names. We centralized helpers (build_signals_v2, run_backtest_with_costs, kpi, load_per_ticker_daily) and called them consistently.
4) Grid search pitfalls.
The initial tuning loop threw ‚Äútoo many values to unpack‚Äù and undefined GRID_FAST. Resolution: define grid lists up front; use a single nested loop (for f in GRID_FAST / for s in GRID_SLOW / for v in GRID_VOL) and return KPI() per combo. Keep the function pure (input fm ‚Üí output summary rows).
5) Sanity checks save time.
A couple asserts caught issues early: date parsing, empty tables, KPI drift (CAGR mismatch). For single-element Series, cast with .iloc[0] to avoid future pandas warnings.
6) DAX should mirror the data you actually ingested.
  -We removed references to nonexistent columns (e.g., sma50, rev_strat), anchored measures to Week-5 fields, and fixed:
    - Latest Close using lastDate = MAX('Date'[Date]) then CALCULATE(MAX(backtest_mart_v2[close]), 'Date'[Date] = lastDate).
    - Monthly heatmap: diverging CF center = 0.00, Month sorted by Month Number.
7) Modeling discipline in Power BI.
Kept single-direction relationships (Date/Ticker ‚Üí facts) to avoid filter ambiguity. The Normalized Close issue for AAPL was traced to filtering/measure scope; verifying ALLSELECTED context and slicers fixed it.
8) UX polish matters.
Consistent number formats, legible line weights, clean slicers, and concise cards made the 3 pages read clearly. Heatmap totals and centered color scale improved interpretation at a glance.

Main issues this week (and how we solved them)

‚ùå Lake paths resolving to notebooks\lake ‚Üí ‚úÖ parent-walk path discovery + warning if duplicate lake exists.

‚ùå Missing parquet columns / name drift ‚Üí ‚úÖ tolerant loader + normalized column names.

‚ùå Undefined helpers / variable names (per_ticker_daily, GRID_FAST) ‚Üí ‚úÖ consolidated helper section + explicit grid lists.

‚ùå Grid tuning ‚Äútoo many values to unpack‚Äù ‚Üí ‚úÖ simplified nested loops; return KPI summary rows.

‚ùå KPI assert mismatch (Series casting) ‚Üí ‚úÖ use .iloc[0] and numeric casts.

‚ùå DAX measures referring to non-ingested fields ‚Üí ‚úÖ measures rewritten to Week-5 fields only (e.g., ret_after_cost, close).

‚ùå Normalized Close missing one ticker ‚Üí ‚úÖ check slicers/filters, ensure measure uses proper filter context, confirm Date‚ÄìTicker relationships.
