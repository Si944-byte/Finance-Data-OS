## 🚀 Project Goal

To build a **modular financial data platform** that takes raw equities, options, and macroeconomic datasets and transforms them into analytics-ready features for trading and investment research.

🛣 Project Roadmap

This project is built and shipped in weekly artifacts. Each week delivers a small but meaningful piece of the pipeline.

Week 1 – Single-Ticker Prototype ✅

  - Ingest raw AAPL daily CSV → Parquet

  - Pandera validation + SMA10

  - First Power BI chart (Close vs SMA10)

Week 2 – Multi-Ticker Ingest & Finance Chart ✅

  - Expanded pipeline to handle multiple tickers (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA)

  - Partitioned Parquet outputs

  - Feature engineering (SMA10)

  - Power BI dashboard with:

  - Closing Price vs SMA lines

  - Volume bars on secondary axis

  - Dynamic chart title linked to slicer

  - Clean finance-style formatting

Week 3 – Expanding History & Feature Store ✅

  - Ingest 5+ years of daily OHLCV per ticker (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA) via yfinance(auto_adjust=True).

  - Write partitioned Parquet lake: lake/ohlcv/ticker=<T>/year=<YYYY>/<T>_<YYYY>.parquet.

  - Repair pass (idempotent): normalize/rename columns, coerce types, enforce ticker/year consistency.

  - Lake validation: required columns, nulls, numeric types, duplicate (ticker,date), partition checks.

  -  Feature engineering v2:

    return1 (daily % return)

    sma10 (10-day simple moving average)

    vol20 (20-day rolling stdev of close)

  - Ship feature_mart.parquet (single tidy table for BI/analytics).

  - Power BI 3-page dashboard:

    Price vs. SMA10 with KPI cards (Latest Close, Latest SMA10, Close vs SMA10 %).

    Volatility & Distribution — daily return line, vol20 trend with reference lines, histogram of returns.

    Overview/Compare — normalized close (start=1.0), summary table (Avg Return %, Vol, Cumulative Return %, Latest Close, CAGR %, Positive Day %), bar chart with conditional formatting.

  - DAX measures: Avg Return %, Vol (stdev of return1), Positive Day %, Latest Close, Latest SMA10, Close vs SMA10 %, Cumulative Return %, CAGR %.

  - Date table (DAX) and relationship to fact tables for robust time slicing.

  - Notebook + build log: Week 3 .ipynb and documentation added for reproducibility.

  (Week 4: optional signal prototypes—e.g., SMA crossovers with walk-forward tests—and scheduled refresh/CI.) (in progress)

## 🚢 Week 2 – Multi-Ticker Ingest & Finance Chart

This week’s artifact expands the Finance Data OS pipeline to handle **multiple tickers (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA)** and deliver a professional-grade visualization.

### ✅ What’s New
- **Multi-ticker ingest** with partitioned Parquet output  
- **Pandera schema validation** applied at the data lake layer  
- **Feature engineering**: 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA10)  
- **Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Closing Price vs 10-day SMA lines  
  - Volume bars on secondary axis  
  - Dynamic chart title linked to ticker slicer  
  - Clean, finance-style formatting (line labels, neutral bars, USD + M units)

### 🧠 What I Learned

**Week 1 – Single-Ticker Prototype**  
- Learned what a **Parquet file** is: a columnar storage format optimized for analytics.  
- Unlike CSV, Parquet is **compressed, faster to query, and schema-aware**, which makes it essential when dealing with **large amounts of financial data**.  
- Saw firsthand how partitioned Parquet reduces storage size and improves performance when scaling beyond one ticker.  

**Week 2 – Multi-Ticker Ingest & Finance Chart**  
- Learned how to extend the pipeline to **multiple tickers** and why partitioning by `ticker` and `year` is critical for efficient querying.  
- Discovered how **Pandera schema validation** enforces data quality rules before the data moves downstream — preventing “bad data” from entering the feature store.  
- Understood how to compute **technical indicators** like SMA (Simple Moving Average) and **returns**, which are core to financial analysis.  
- Improved skills in **Power BI visualization**: building combo charts, formatting axes, and designing finance-ready dashboards that balance clarity and detail. (really focused on cleaning up the charts this week)
