🛠️ Build Log – Week 2

Goal: Expand the Finance Data OS from single-ticker to multi-ticker ingest, add schema validation, and ship a professional Power BI chart.

Day 1 – Multi-Ticker Setup

Defined ticker list: ["AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA"].

Built read_csv_to_df() function to loop through tickers.

Validated ingestion works for multiple CSVs.

✅ Learned: writing reusable ingestion functions is much cleaner than copy/pasting.

Day 2 – Partitioned Parquet

Implemented partitioning by ticker and year.

Verified directory structure:

lake/ohlcv/
  ├── ticker=AAPL/year=2024/
  ├── ticker=MSFT/year=2024/
  └── ticker=TSLA/year=2024/


✅ Learned: partitioning early will make scaling to 5+ years easier.

Day 3 – Schema Validation with Pandera

Created OHLCVSchema with Pandera.

Tested schema validation on sample parquet files.

Fixed issue with missing Ticker field in schema.

✅ Learned: schema validation gives confidence in downstream features.

Day 4 – Feature Engineering (Mart)

Combined parquet files into a single mart file.

Added 10-day SMA (SMA10) and daily returns (Return1).

Saved mart/ohlcv_features.parquet for Power BI.

✅ Learned: groupby().transform() is a powerful way to add rolling features.

Day 5 – Power BI Dashboard

Imported mart parquet into Power BI.

Built combo chart: Closing Price vs SMA lines + Volume bars.

Styled chart:

Dynamic title linked to slicer.

USD + M axis labels.

Neutral volume bars, colored SMA + Close lines.

Added line labels to remove legend clutter.

✅ Learned: finance-style formatting requires attention to both clarity and accuracy.
