ðŸš¢ Build Log â€” Week 1

This week I shipped the first artifact of my Finance Data OS project.

ðŸ’¡ The goal: build an end-to-end data system for financial markets that I can grow from data analyst-level dashboards â†’ data engineer-level pipelines â†’ data scientist-level research.

Hereâ€™s what I accomplished in Week 1:

âœ… Built a Jupyter notebook that ingests raw CSVs of stock prices (AAPL to start)

âœ… Wrote them to Parquet, partitioned by ticker & year (data-lake style)

âœ… Added Pandera schema validation for data quality checks

âœ… Engineered first features (Close, SMA10)

âœ… Connected the output to Power BI and built a simple prototype dashboard

Next up (Week 2)

Ingest multiple tickers instead of one CSV

Expand the dashboard with a ticker slicer

Document the system with architecture diagrams
